- wobble on land
- vehicle damage ontrigger





TESTEN:
- Picture quality == boost feedback

- or reward with boost amount (boost bar)

- Center frame
- object orientation
- anti-objects
- Special Focal points


        - Depth of field / focus
- AutoFocus
- Slider minigame focus



========= DONE:
- Doors only open on boost
- Cam Now Recenters/redirects to front on exiting cameramode 
- Without steering, using drift now halts you (faster than brake). 
- Gas + brake = velocity 0
- brake + drift = brake the brake xD
- Basic Cam collision
- New Camera try-out. Matching the old steering feel + Loop de loop working again. More racing-camera like
- 1st person Cam jumpt mee
- 1st person Cam gaat mee met loop-de-loop :D
- Veel smoothere damping voor alles
- Betere transition van 3rd -> 1st
