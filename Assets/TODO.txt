======= PICTURE GRADING
- 1 Qualifier stage per keer (don't mix too many qualifiers)
- Sequence of cinematics / volgordesysteem
- Slowmotion carries on during grading
- Grade system based on school-system (A tm F)
- FOCUS is the only grade that is consistently important.
- MOTION INST & CENTERFRAME are togglable 
- BORDERS OF PICTURE === COLOR === TOTAL SCORE    
- PICTURE NAME contains data about keypoints/how much of the object is captured, some bonus categories like DIRTY become the adjective.
        DIRTY TOWER (1/3)
        [Buzz-word category / genre / bonus] [Main Subject] [Amount of keypoints in frame]



- In de [[[[BONUS]]]] stage (na focus stage), wordt een minimumwaarde voor focus gebruikt om te bepalen of bonus items uberhaupt REGISTREREN
en uberhaupt dus invloed hebben op grading 
AKA
Minimum focus per non-important object on screen decides whether grading happens.
