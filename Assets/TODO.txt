???? - 2 SHADERS AT A TIME BLENDING - Continu 


- Search & find markers in minimap


[- Wat gebeurt er als portfolio op capaciteit limiet zit? Photo replacement?]


- Scrolling/Selection with d pad in portfolio



- Mission gets crossed after delivering picture
- physical delivery
- Picture Score for mission aanduiden naast de mission statement 


After Photo taken:
        - LB & RB for scroll picture selection in portfolio mode
3 buttons
        - (B) Discard Picture + skip
        - (Y) Mark for mission (greyed out if not possible) [Active mission only or all accepted?] 
        - (A) Skip + Portfolio




- PictureScore + Splash = Mission accomplished! This could be used for mission -> Press A to stamp for mission
- Mission completion 


- Physical picture gets sucked to mission marker

- Dynamic sizing crosshairs based on distance

- FOCUS BEPAALT OOK MAIN SUBJECT. NIET ALLEEN HOE CENTERFRAME



- Looking up / down

SYSTEM RULES:
        - ALL OBJECTIVES + OPTIONALS CAN ONLY BE CLEARED WITH 1 PICTURE. ALL OR NOTHING, YOU GOT 1 SHOT.
        - Partial completion gets marked off temporarily, as an animation. 
        - Subject Priority Calculation in photomode is based on how close to center reticle
        - Picture Scoring System & Missions System are not connected, but they do communicate

Types of bonus:
        - Mission bonus (+) & penalty (-)
        - Global bonus (+) & penalty (-)
        - Subject-inherent bonus (+) & penalty (-)



========= Physics
- Snelheid drift brake als variabel
- BOOST CAP
- Boost cancel force
- Coyote time jumping before 0.25f groundpercent


- destructible objecten triggers? dont cancel speed. (maybe freeze frame) haptic feedback + sound
- No wallriding anymore / toggle


======= PhotoItem
- Category Tags
- Relative Bonus?
- Global bonus?

======= PICTURE GRADING
- 1 Qualifier stage per keer (don't mix too many qualifiers)
- Sequence of cinematics / volgordesysteem
- Slowmotion carries on during grading
- Grade system based on school-system (A tm F)
- FOCUS is the only grade that is consistently important.
- MOTION INST & CENTERFRAME are togglable 
- BORDERS OF PICTURE === COLOR === TOTAL SCORE    
- PICTURE NAME contains data about keypoints/how much of the object is captured, some bonus categories like DIRTY become the adjective.
        DIRTY TOWER (1/3)
        [Buzz-word category / genre / bonus] [Main Subject] [Amount of keypoints in frame]


- Flipperkast achtige feel. Visual Stamps. Real-time visual correspondence to score based on grading stage [Waardes blijven veranderen]




- In de [[[[BONUS]]]] stage (na focus stage), wordt een minimumwaarde voor focus gebruikt om te bepalen of bonus items uberhaupt REGISTREREN
en uberhaupt dus invloed hebben op grading 
AKA
Minimum focus per non-important object on screen decides whether grading happens.

???? Bonus objects global or relative? (based on main subject)
        SHARKS ARE ALWAYS COOL
        or
        SHARK(subject) LIKES PRULLENBAK, but PRULLENBAK(subject) DOES NOT LIKE SHARK

======== MISSION SYSTEM
- MINIMUM GRADE
- CHECKBOXES
- Multiple objects/photoitems per mission??? (not possible with picture grading, since it's losgekoppeld)

- BONUS OBJECTS:
        - GLOBAL (Sharks are cool, advertisements are always bad)
        - MISSION-SPECIFIC (Now advertisements are cool, endorse me!! Broom, Carwash)

                - 180 flipped photo bonus (transform.up)        [STUNT]             (barrel roll!)
                - Rotation bonus (Dutch & Ondersteboven)
                - smoke grenades / priming the picture ---- pushing objects into composition should be +++++ BONUS          [STUNT / OBJECTS]

                - exhaust on picture should be ------ farting CO2 bonus reduction

        - DEPTH OF FIELD SWEEPING RANGE MORE DYNAMIC / AUTOMATICALLY BIGGER ON CLOSE RANGE OBJECTS



- Photographic memory ||| level selection screen ||| Level defining picture ||| your pictures in main menu defining the levels |||| hall of fame
- Export functie || exporter building printing your picture into local desktop drive file. Costs money too. External location 4th wall break.
- Print screen is money down easter egg



AUDIO:
- Landing sounds / crashing sounds
- Beep beep voor achteruit?
- Better Boost sound effect  





[[[BUGS]]:
- PRESS X IN MID AIR LMAO
- Boost still triggering haptic feedback when meter is empty



TESTEN:
- Picture quality == boost feedback
- Reward with boost amount in fuel (boost bar)                  of              direct boost reward in force
- AutoFocus (based on reticle)




== [Optional]
- wobble on land visual + better haptics
- vehicle damage fixen + ontrigger?
- Screen diagonal split for cutscene / different visuals



========= DONE:
- Fixes
- UI Layering fixes
- Camera shader change iets smoother (nogsteeds wel lag spike op het begin, omdat alles nog moet laden enzo)
- 3rd person to 1st perspective is WAY smoother. The Postprocess FX blend in during the transition.
- Project cleanups
- Level area system (it shows the name of map area on enter)
- Mission system progress
- RAYCAST 3D RETICLE 
- Object scan text, different formatting (No "!" for keypoints) for keypoints
- Object orientations!
- Composite objects now work & tweakable with PhotoKeyPoint script on object + Nice editing visuals in scene view

- 0/X picture capacity van portfolio staat er bij
